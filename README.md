# ssh-login-bruteforce
# Usage example
brute_force_ssh('example.com', 22, 'admin')

An SSH brute force attack involves repeatedly
trying different username and password combinations
until we gain access to the remote server.
We may use automated tools that can try thousands of
username and password combinations in a matter of seconds,
making it a fast and effective way to compromise a server.

How it works?
An SSH brute force attack exploits weak or default passwords
that are commonly used on servers. These passwords
can be easily guessed by using common passwords lists and
automated tools.
